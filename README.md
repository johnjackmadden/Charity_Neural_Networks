# Deep Neural Network Learning and Charity Work
## Objective
### The objective of this excercise was to utalize machine learning using tensorflow and google colab to train various models to determine weather or not a charitable donation to an organization would be effective or not, which is classified as a > 75% accuracy rating.
## Results
### Data Cleaning
- The variable that is considered a target for my model are IS_SUCCESFFUL, since that is the purpose of this excercise to determine the viability of having a donation make a difference for a charity organization
- The variables that are considered features for my model are the Application_Type, Affiliation, Classification, Organization, Status, Income, Speclai_Considerations, and Ask_Amt. These variables were encoded and then split into training sets for the data set 
- The variables that were removed from my data were the EIN and NAME tags from the data set
### Model Training
- How many neurons and why
- We were succesfully able to meet the target critera of above a 75% accuracy rating
- THe steps that I took to increase the model accuracy was to increase the nodes and to add addtional epochs
## Summary
### I was able to achieve over 75% accuracy on the training set after increasing the number of epochs for my training set. Adding additional neural lays may also increase preformance with some level of diminishing returns at the cost of my energy use and time for processing the data through additional nodes.
